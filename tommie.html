  The Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut has been unveiled. It is the fastest Koenigsegg ever made and the company will never endeavor to make a faster series-production road car – ever. Customers will be able to choose between the Jesko Absolut and the more track-oriented Jesko version that was presented a year ago.
  Every surface element on the Jesko Absolut has been purposefully constructed to reduce drag or surrounding turbulence around the car while increasing high-speed stability. Although just as powerful, the Jesko Absolut is a more seamless and stealthier interpretation of the Jesko, its track-focused sibling.
  The Jesko Absolut has a drag coefficient value of only 0.278 Cd. The low drag in combination with a frontal area of 1.88 m2 in combination with a power level of minimum 1600 bhp, make the Jesko Absolut destined to achieve higher, more extraordinary speeds than any Koenigsegg or any other fully homologated car before it. – How fast? Time will tell. Looking at the math and our advanced simulations – it will be unbelievably fast.
Both the Jesko (track-oriented version) and the Jesko Absolut (high-speed version) will be powered by a 1280 bhp (1600 bhp on E85), twin turbo charged V8 engine, featuring the world’s lightest V8 crankshaft that weighs just 12.5 kg. This new flat-plane 180-degree crankshaft produces more power with greater efficiency while achieving a higher 8500 rpm rev limit. The flat-plane design allows even firing across engine banks, creating a visceral engine sound that gives more power. Koenigsegg’s engine architect, Dr. Thomas Johansson has also designed super-light connecting rods and pistons to counter the tendency of greater vibrations in flat-plane engines

  The Jesko Absolut presented a rigorous exercise in smoothing out surfaces on the car to remove any form of drag-causing elements while adding rear volumes that streamline the airflow. Over 3000 hours have been invested in fluid dynamics (CFD) and aerodynamics analysis, alongside over 5000 hours of design and engineering for the Jesko Absolut on top of the Jesko. The CFD team meticulously went over every inch and design detail of the car, defining the elements needed to get to the drag coefficient even lower than the target of 0.28 Cd, to just 0.278 Cd.
  Most obvious when looking at the Jesko Absolut, is the removed massive rear wing. The wing is removed to reduce downforce and drag – dropping downforce from 1400 kg to 150 kg.
  In place of a rear wing there are two rear hood fins that are designed to enhance the high-speed stability of the Absolut.
  Furthermore, the front splitter and side winglets are removed, and the front wheel louvers are replaced with smoother ones. Every surface is analyzed and optimized for the air to glide as effortless as possible over, under and through the body.
  The Jesko Absolut shape was reassessed with minimal drag in mind. This meant elongating the car, giving it a more tear-dropped shape. The rear extension of the Jesko Absolut makes it 85 mm longer than the track-focused Jesko and the dished rear wheels, really change its appearance.

The Koenigsegg Light Speed Transmission (LST) represents a scale of evolution not seen since the development of modern dual-clutch technology (DCT) at the turn of the century.
LST is Koenigsegg’s latest gearbox innovation comprising nine forward gears and several wet, multi-disc clutches in a compact, ultra-light package. It is capable of gear changes between any gear, at near light speed. This is thanks to the simultaneous opening and closing of clutches, which make the driving experience so seamless that it feels like the driver and car are symbiotically connected.
Equally revolutionary is the size and weight of the LST. Modern high-performance DCTs can easily weigh well in excess of 120 kg, yet the nine-speed Koenigsegg LST transmission weighs just 90 kg, including fluids.
The package is also half the size of the previous Koenigsegg transmissions. This small size keeps the weight closer to the center of the car, improving weight distribution and handling.
Standard modern dual-clutch transmissions (DCT) are designed to predict and pre-select the next gear based on inputs from the driver. However, if that prediction is wrong, the driver will experience G-force losses and slow shift response. In addition, DCTs only work in single-gear intervals.
The LST, on the other hand, overcomes the normal DCT-problems via its unique multi-clutch design and “UPOD” technology – Ultimate Power On Demand. UPOD is the brain that instantly selects and engages optimum gearing for maximum acceleration. It selects the ideal gear for maximum power with a light-speed gear change, regardless of how far away the gear is. UPOD uses vehicle and engine speed to determine the correct gear for maximum power and directs the LST to engage that gear.
The effect is instant, available power that’s always optimized in RPM range and RPM reach, allowing maximum acceleration for overtaking, corner exits and smooth overtaking. In a world of instant gratification, this is power on demand like never experienced before.
