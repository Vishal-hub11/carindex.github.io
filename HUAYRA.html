A spontaneous, unstoppable emotion. A burning desire that led the Client to dream of a new work of art: another Pagani creation. This is how, in 2017, the idea of the Huayra Roadster BC came to life. From a curious set of circumstances, a demanding research project was launched with a meticulous, almost obsessive focus on details and design in order to create a highly distinctive, street-legal Pagani hypercar that would combine the unparalleled sensations of driving a roadster with the most advanced technology available today
Every effort made by the Pagani team, whose designers, engineers and master craftsmen work continuously to achieve the most extreme levels of scientific research and uniqueness, was focused on the pursuit of an ideal: to exceed the customer’s expectations and repay his absolute faith. This trial of unprecedented dedication was finally completed under the guidance and discipline of the ultimate polymath, Horacio Pagani.
Each and every component of this hypercar is the result of scrupulous analysis and Team Pagani’s critical approach that is specifically designed to constantly question every outcome and achievement. As the only way to guarantee true perfection is to never fall too much in love with the successes attained, but rather being able to observe them with a critical eye.
All this effort was translated into innovation, invention and exploration of unexplored paths in order to break new ground, never follow car trends and always seek to build truly timeless creations. This is the essence of the Roadster BC. Extreme, exuberant and shaped by hand in line with the fundamental concepts of Leonardo da Vinci’s Art and Science, the cornerstones of Pagani Automobili’s creative philosophy.
A road machine created with the latest technologies derived by Pagani Automobili’s track experience and in accordance with the key concepts of Pagani’s DNA. In other words, an intuitive and easy-to-drive vehicle you can master after just a few miles and in which you can enjoy a full open-top experience without affecting the performance.
From the aerodynamics to its exterior and interior design, and right down to its tiniest part, Roadster BC’s chemistry and combination of advanced composite materials are unprecedented. Also, the elements that escape the eye of the expert have been optimized to offer genuine emotions and reach new horizons on multiple fronts.
Like in a sophisticated watch, every single component of the Roadster BC is a concentration of Pagani Automobili’s ultimate design,  technology and engineering expertise encapsulated in just 1,250 kg (2,756 lbs).
Can one focus on extreme performance without compromising satisfying, smooth driveability? Can lightness and safety be fused with design and elegance? The solutions lie in the agile and expert hands of those who believe that perfection and uniqueness can only be reached through painstaking care, manual skill and craftsmanship.
Pagani aspires for perfection, creating the greatest hand-built cars with a true hymn to the Renaissance.

The Roadster BC features new, exclusive composite technologies based on carbon fibre and carbon-titanium that offer an increase of 12% in torsional rigidity and 20% in flexional rigidity compared to Pagani Automobili’s state of the art technology till today. This increase in the mechanical properties of the materials applied, in particular in the chassis torsional and flexional rigidity, also allows its dynamic response to be augmented when driving, as well as its safety in critical conditions.
“Through intense scientific research for developing the Carbo-Triax HP62 and Carbon-Titanium HP62 G2 formulas, we succeeded in achieving some extraordinary results that allowed us to reduce the weight of the vehicle considerably and optimise mechanical features. Even so, when we presented these achievements to Horacio, along with the fact that they involved a 450% increase in material costs, his reaction was, “the customer deserves even more!”
– Francesco Perini, Head of Concept & Composite Design.
What is great about this working relationship is that we have the same attitude. We’re never satisfied with the status quo as Horacio Pagani always puts what is normally taken as proven to the test. I think that, together, we have always believed we could overcome even the most difficult challenge and attain ever-higher levels of perfection.”
– Tobias Moers, CEO of Mercedes-AMG GmbH.
Know-how, tradition and over 125 years of technical history for Mercedes-Benz and 50 for AMG plus 20 years of close cooperation with Pagani, a universe of knowledge for giving birth to the Pagani V12. A completely new engine that boasts a level of power and elasticity that will glue drivers to their seat and leave its mark on their shoulders. 800 hp and a torque of 1,050 NM already at 2,000 rpm, with one of the best weight-power ratios in the category. The Pagani V12 features a set of innovations, including two new turbos, a revolutionary hydroformed manifold, twin throttle bodies and four water- air intercoolers; all of this supported by a sophisticated electronic system designed by Bosch for making the maximum use of its potential.
Last, but not least, this jewel complies with the latest international carbon footprint and gas emission standards, including California’s
environmental regulations, without having to resort to a hybrid system.
