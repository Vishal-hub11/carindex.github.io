A pure fusion of science and art in automotive form. The Speedtail is McLaren’s first ever Hyper-GT. Our most aerodynamically efficient car ever. And the fastest McLaren to date. With a pioneering 1070PS hybrid powertrain at its core. It brings together unprecedented levels of innovation and elegance to create a new benchmark in automotive design. And offers owners extraordinary opportunity for bespoke personalisation.
McLaren’s design mantra, everything for a reason, holds true through every last detail of the Speedtail. The design is one of pure, streamlined elegance. Born out of the single-minded vision to create the most aerodynamically efficient car ever, there is an uninterrupted flow of air from nose to tail. The dramatically elongated tail is as distinct in the automotive world as the Speedtail’s incredible velocity. With a host of innovations, the design minimises all unnecessary shutlines. This creates an outline so sleek it seems hewn from a single form. This is minimalist elegance at its apex. All honed around extraordinary, ground-breaking, performance.Just 12.8 seconds. That’s all it takes for the Speedtail to reach 300km/h from a standing start. This is the fastest acceleration delivered by any McLaren to date. But the Speedtail is a car that pushes ever further. Keep on accelerating, and the car will reach its staggering top speed of 403km/h (250mph) – higher than any car we’ve ever created. Outstripping even the McLaren F1. It’s the combined result of a stunning aerodynamic design. A dry weight of only 1,430kg. And the immense force of the 1,050PS petrol-electric powertrain. Discover the incredible specification of the McLaren Speedtail.

The Speedtail breaks new boundaries. Not simply through its performance. But also in the level of customisation it offers across colour, materials and textures. The vision was to realise the ultimate achievement in bespoke design. To create 106 totally unique cars. And it’s precisely this limited production number that has enabled us to push into unchartered territory. What we’ve created is an astonishing collection of exclusive, innovative materials. Many are inspired by the non-automotive worlds of high fashion, luxury yachts and bespoke furniture. And many, too, have truly never been seen on a car before. Together, they offer Speedtail owners scope for personalisation that’s nothing short of unprecedented.A twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 and an electric motor join forces here, producing a total output of 1035 horsepower and 848 lb-ft of torque. Velocity mode tailors the car's powertrain and active dynamics to help it achieve optimum speed. This mode, which comes standard, can also be used to lower the car by 1.4 inches. This hypercar's acceleration capabilities are spellbinding. According to McLaren, the Speedtail rockets from a standstill to 186 mph in just 12.8 seconds. That makes it quicker off the line than the storied McLaren P1, which made that run in 16.5 seconds.
