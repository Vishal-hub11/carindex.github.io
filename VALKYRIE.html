Aston Martin has confirmed some specs of its track-only version of the Valkyrie hypercar. The AMR Pro version, which was first revealed in its concept stage at the 2018 Geneva motor show, will start dominating racing circuits across the world towards the end of 2021.
The biggest change is the Valkyrie's naturally-aspirated 6.5-litre V12 – Aston has ditched the hybrid powertrain for the AMR Pro 'in pursuit of the lightest weigt and fastest lap times,' meaning power drops from 1,160bhp to 1,000bhp. Still, Aston's confidently set a target for the AMR Pro: a lap of the 8.5-mile Le Mans circuit in 3m 20s.
Along with the engine tweaks, the AMR Pro features carbonfibre suspension wishbones, a Perspex windscreen and aero that 'exceeds Le Mans Hypercar regulations.'
How? Well, the wheelbase is 380mm longer and 96mm wider than a standard Valkyrie and features a bespoke bodykit for slamming the Valkyrie into the tarmac, including a mammoth front splitter that adds another 266mm to the length of the car.
The first deliveries of the Valkyrie AMR Pro are expected to start at the end of 2021 – Aston says all of them will be left-hand drive and just 40 will be made.
The Aston Martin Valkyrie excitement continues. The brand released images of the upcoming hypercar on public roads for the first time in March 2020. The car was tested with Chris Goodwin at the wheel on roads near the Silverstone race circuit.
On top of that, recently three verification prototypes of Gaydon's hypercar took to the track itself as another step in the car's test procedure takes shape.
VP1, which already made fans take notice at the 2019 British Grand Prix, was handed over to Max Verstappen and Alex Albon - Red Bull Racing's 2020 F1 drivers. Alongside VP1, prototypes VP2 and VP3 also took to the track with legendary test driver Chris Goodwin and AMR WEC drivers, Darren Turner and Alex Lynn at the wheel.

To be one of the first guys to drive an insane car like this was really exciting. It was amazing to get a first taste of it its levels of downforce are incredible, and it looks super aggressive. It was a lot of fun out there,’ Verstappen said about the car. '
Albon added: 'Obviously, there’s still some development to do, but already it feels very good, especially the balance between the corners. It’s light; it feels sharp. Sure, compared to an F1 car, you’re missing the outright downforce, but you still feel the Gs in the corners and it definitely reacts closer to an F1 car than a normal road car.
Aston Martin’s new Valkyrie hypercar is being developed with Red Bull Racing and Cosworth, both companies with a fine F1 pedigree. Which might explain why it will deliver a massive 1160bhp total power output at a heady 10,500rpm, as well as 664lb ft at 6000rpm, according to the specs released in summer 2019.
The company has released the full performance specs of the V12, and the Rimac-sourced hybrid system; the electric assistance makes up 160bhp and 207lb ft - enough to power a decently fast warm hatchback in its own right.
The epic project is in its final planning and production stages. CAR visited Aston Martin HQ in spring 2019 and talked with executive VP and chief creative officer, Marek Reichman. ‘We’re approximately two years in, as we signed the first paperwork in Melbourne in 2017,’ said Reichman. ‘The first engines are being mounted to the first tubs that will form part of the crash program, but they’ll do a lot of our development testing as well.

At the same time, Aston Martin also revealed an AMR Track Pack (see below) for those who are currently in the incredibly detailed process of specifying their own Valkyrie. Aston claims that the Track Pack can deliver around 8% quicker lap times for those looking to muster every last millisecond out of their track time, depending on track conditions.
What’s in the Track Pack? Well, there’s a new front clamshell and a whole new set of body panels for even better aero, superlight titanium brakes, magnesium wheels with carbon aero discs and a new suspension setup that includes updated dampers and roll bars, plus a 50mm decrease in ride height. The whole pack takes Aston Martin two days to swap the panels around.

You sit very near the car’s centre-line and very close to your passenger, but there is decent fore/aft room, though. Reichman is 6ft 3in tall and fits in just fine. You sit angled 2º inwards. You’re aware of the feet-up driving position, necessary as air gushes under your feet to work the underbody aero magic.
